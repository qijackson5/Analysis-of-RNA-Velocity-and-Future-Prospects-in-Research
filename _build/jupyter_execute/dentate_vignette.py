# Preprocess the data and determine tunable parameters. In practice, this is an explorattory process, and highly specific to a given dataset and underlying question. 

# Setting the minimum number of cells required to be expressed (both spliced and unspliced transcripts) to 25 and the number of genes to keep to 2500

# Computing the moments for velocity estimation. 1st/2nd order moments are computer, for each cell, across its nearest neighbors. The neighbor graph is obtained from euclidean distances in PCA space. Here, the number of neighbors to use is set to 30, and the number of principal components is set to 25.

# Performing velocity analysis in both steady state and stochastic modes

# The stochastic mode is a further development from the steady state mode, that treats transcription, splicing, and degradation dynamics as probabilistic events who resulting Markov process is approximated by moment equations. The steady state mode more simply approximates the equilibrium with a linear regressionâ€”a key (false) assumption behind this being that there exists a common splicing rate across all genes.
